####################################################################################
#
config-version: 1.1.5
# WARNING: Do not change this value as this might end up in a plugin that does not work!!
#----------------------------------------------Language-------------------------------------------------

# Here you can change the language of the plugin.
language-file: lang-en.yml

# See this link for all available language files: https://gpplugins.gitbook.io/economyshopgui/file-configuration/languages#currently-supported-languages


#-----------------------------------------------Locale--------------------------------------------------

# This is the locale of the plugin.
# Currently its only used to format the prices.
locale: en-US

# Note: This is not the locale at which messages will be translated, see the above option for that.
# The locale is set in BCP 47 language tag.
# See this website for some example BCP 74 language tag you can use: https://appmakers.dev/bcp-47-language-codes-list/


#-----------------------------------------------Updates-------------------------------------------------

# This option enables or disables the automatic checking of updates for the plugin on startup or reload of the plugin
update-checking: true


#----------------------------------------------DebugMode------------------------------------------------

# Set this value to false to disable debug mode and do not send debug messages to the console.
debug: true
# NOTE: The console may get spammed when debug mode is enabled.


#---------------------------------------DisabledCommandsInWorlds----------------------------------------

# The setting below enables or disables the disabled commands inside certain worlds feature
# When this option is true, the commands that are added to the world inside the list below will be disabled
enable-disabled-worlds: false

# List of commands with disabled worlds
# Each command has its own list of worlds that will be disabled.
# If a command is not added or the list with worlds for the specified command is empty,
# the command will work in every world.
disabled-worlds-per-command:
    shop:
    - 'testbuilding'
    sellall:
    - 'randompvp'
    editshop:
    - 'boss-fights'
    - 'Survival-Spawn'

# NOTE: Commands disabled inside worlds with the feature above will still be registered inside the server,
# meaning that a command still can conflict with the same command from another plugin.


#--------------------------------------------SpawnerProvider--------------------------------------------

# This option can be used to set an external spawner provider to use for the spawners inside the shop
# Available values:
# DEFAULT = The default spawner provider inside ESGUI
# SILKSPAWNERS = An external spawner provider
# WILDSTACKER = An external spawner provider
spawner-provider: DEFAULT
# NOTE: When there is no spawner provider set, the default will be used


#------------------------------------------PlayerTransactions-------------------------------------------

# When this option is set to true, every time a player sells/buys something from the server, it will output it in the console.
# This way the server owner or staff can see when a item is bought/sold many times or control/correct prices and exploits in the shop.
log-player-transactions: true
# Set to false to disable this.

# Should we drop the remaining items on the ground when the players inventory is full?
drop-remaining-items-on-ground: false
# When this option is false, the plugin will only give the items that fit inside the inventory and the remaining items will be cancelled. The player will only pay for the amount of items that fit inside the inventory.
# Warning: When this option is true, players could lag out your server by buying an insane amount of items that fall on the ground!


#-----------------------------------------------MainShop------------------------------------------------

# Set the size of the main shop inventory
# Possible values: 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
mainshop-size: 6
# Note that the navigation bar also is 1 row which can't be disabled currently


#---------------------------------------------ItemSettings----------------------------------------------

# Enable/disable the lore on items given to players when a item is bought from shop
bought-items-lore: true

# Allows enchants greater than the max that Mojang has specified.
allow-unsafe-enchants: true

# The NBT Tags listed below will be ignored when a item gets sold to the shop
# For example:
# When a tool/armor is damaged it cannot be sold to the server by default, if you add the 'Damage' tag to the list below. A damaged item can be sold to the shop
sold-items-ignored-NBTtags:
- 'RepairCost'
# The 'RepairCost' tag is added by default since all items that get repaired by anvil/mending will get it, if we don't add it to the ignored list, a item repaired will not be able to be sold to the server

# Enable or disable discounts inside the shop
enable-discounts: false

# Here you can set all discounts active inside the shop
# Every entry is a shop section that holds the permission nodes with their discounts
discounts:
    Blocks:
      vip: 20
      gold: 2.5
    Farming:
      vip: 15
    Redstone:
      diamond: 30
# If a player has for example access to 2 permission discounts inside the same shop section, the group with the highest discount will be active

# Set the limit for maximum pages inside a shop section, default is 50 but you can expand it to 100 if needed
max-shop-pages: 50
# Note: 50 pages is already a limit of 2250 items(50 * 45) inside one shop section which will most likely never be used.
# We only decided to add a limit to this to prevent people from making a shop with a redundant amount of pages(1000/5000/...),
# if you really need more pages inside your shop which will most likely never happen, just join our support server and tell us why you need it, we will increase this limit only if we see this being a need.


#-----------------------------------------------Commands------------------------------------------------

# These are the commands included in EconomyShopGUI
# Set an command to true to enable it, and set an command to false to disable it.

commands:
    sellall: true
    shop: true
    sreload: true
    editshop: true


#-------------------------------------------DisableBackButton-------------------------------------------

# This option will enable/disable disabling the back button when opening a shop section directly by the command /shop <section>
# This option is use full if you have a NPC plugin setup when you click on it it will open a specific shop section, this will prevent the players to go back to the main menu and choose another shop section.
disableBackButtonWithShopSectionCommand: false


#----------------------------------------------JoinMessage----------------------------------------------

# Here you can enable or disable the JoinMessage
enable-joinmessage: false


#-----------------------------------------------LevelEvent----------------------------------------------

leveleventmoney20/25/30: 50


#-----------------------------------------------SpawnerSettings---------------------------------------

# If you set this to 'false' you can only place spawners that are bought, you won't be able to get them back with an (Silk Touch) pickaxe.
enable-spawnerbreak: true

# When this option is set to false, you will no longer be able to place spawners bought from the shop with the EconomyShopGUI spawner system.
enable-spawnerplace: true

# This option will disable/enable the XP dropped when a spawner is broken.
player-placed-spawners-drop-exp: false

# Here you can set the item material of what a player has to break its spawner with so he gets the item!
# You can set 2 items and if they need silk touch

    1: DIAMOND_PICKAXE
    silk1: true
    2: IRON_PICKAXE
    silk2: false
